==============================

Mobile network security suite based on dSploit. CrockPotVeggies style.

Original app copyright Simone Margaritelli. http://www.dsploit.net/

-------------

VeggieRecipies is an Android network analysis and penetration suite which aims to offer to IT security experts/geeks
**the most complete and advanced professional toolkit** to perform network security assesments on a mobile device.

Once VeggieRecipies is started, you will be able to easily map your network, fingerprint alive hosts operating systems
and running services, search for **known vulnerabilities**, crack logon procedures of many tcp protocols, perform
man in the middle attacks such as **password sniffing** ( with common protocols dissection ), real time **traffic
manipulation**, etc, etc.

Requirements
-------------

- An Android device with at least the 2.3 ( Gingerbread ) version of the OS.
- The device **must be rooted**.
- The device must have a BusyBox **full install**, this means with **every** utility installed ( not the partial installation ).

Note
-------------

The app is made to work only in landscape mode and will stay landscape even if you rotate your device, if you have an application such as Rotation Control to force every app to rotate, probably you are going to see dSploit crash.
This is something i want to be like this, every interface is designed to work in landscape, so do not submit issues related to rotation.
